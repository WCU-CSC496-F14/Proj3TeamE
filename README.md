Okay guys, please go to this website. https://github.com/cykod/Quintus/commit/d68f5991c341e019b842377ef9e379aba2d4de38

This is where we'll start to fix the code so it works for us, we may very likely have to switch some names of files and folders, No problem.

I downloaded the platform example, but I anticipate changing all of the graphics, ( to scale of course) and adding at least some fun stuff. including music.

here's a link to the tutorial for how to add music.

Kelsey will handle the JSON level files. ( need two levels that take at least 60 seconds to traverse)
Chris is on sprites,(make things pretty)
David will do audio( lazer sounds pew pew)



Tasks to do:

Sprites move Quintus animamtions
Start Screen
Game-Over screen
some indication of a game state (number of lives left, a timer, number of points.) something to indicate progression.
