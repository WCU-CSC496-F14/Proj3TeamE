            <p>This is a group programming assignment.</p>
            
            <p>Points: 50</p>
            
			<p>Create the following game of pong in JavaScript (without a game engine), accomplishing these requirements:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Make a 1-player, side-scroller, that is played on one workstation.</li>
				<li>The game should be "Mario"-like, similar to the Full Platformer (example #11) on the Quintus home page.</li>
				<li>At a minimum, the following should be implemented:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The Tiled Map should be extensive enough such that for each level a player at fastest pace
					can't complete the level in under 30 seconds (give or take). There should be enough
					substance to the level that a typical player would be expected to spend approximately
					two minutes before completing it (unless they die in the process, if that's possible in your game).
					</li><li>Some game state (relative to the objective of your game, such as number of lives remaining,
					number of points, timer, ...) should be displayed in a UI container.</li>
					<li>There are sounds!</li>
					<li>Sprite(s) move via Quintus animations.</li>
					<li>There is initial start screen and a game over screen.</li>
					<li>Fun stuff! (your group's choice)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Come up with a game idea (sooner rather than later). Get creative; any game
						is fine as long as the above requirements are met. (Your game doesn't have to be "Mario".) Commit to the game idea; there
						is very limited time for implementation. Draw up the storyboards for your game. Start coding.
						For the intermediate deadline, your group will be responsible to present in 5-10 
						minutes (hard upper bound): your game idea, a demo of what you have done so far, 
						storyboards of your vision (and unimplemented
						features), and a solicitation of opinions and critique from the class.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>Remember my advice: to base the implementation of your game off of the Basic Platformer (example #8),
				and only use the Full Platformer (example #11) as necessary for figuring out extra bells and whistles.</li>
			</ul>

            <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
			<em>(Same as Project #1)</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Completing the above requirements.</li>
                <li>The game should also be as fun as possible. <i>(Yes, this is subjective!)</i> But any "clunkiness",
                or aspects of the game that are not "polished", are worthy of point deductions. The team with the "funnest"
                (subjective) game based on the above requirements will receive bonus points.</li>
                <li>Documented code.</li>
            	<li>Use of a git repository.</li>
            	<li>Peer-review of your effort and contribution to the project by your teammates. <u>In no circumstances should
            	a single team member "run away" with the project and do the entire program. In no circumstances should
            	a team member not contribute.</u> The expectation for this project is that every member of the team should
            	be able to explain the project code.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Code Repository</h2>
			<p>Your team should use GitHub again. There is a repository for each team. See me
			if you do not have access.</p>

            
            <h2>Teams</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Team A: </b> Cosentino, Girven, Haney</li>
            <li><b>Team B: </b> Hunsicker, Mason, Rauenzahn</li>
            <li><b>Team C: </b> Sadreameli, McKenna, Paparo</li>
            <li><b>Team D: </b> Bowers, Korogodsky, Wallace </li>
            <li><b>Team E: </b> Demitis, Gazula, Scheeler, Vincent</li>
            <li><b>Team F: </b> Iannacone, Ottenberg, Tate</li>
            <li><b>Team G: </b> Gordon, King, Laymon</li>
